    \textbf{Software Engineer I, II} \tab[.25cm] \textit{Root Insurance} \tab[.15cm] \small {Columbus OH} \hfill \small {March, 2020} \\
    \tab[0.5cm] \textit{Technology Used:} Python, AWS, Docker, git, BuildKite, Terraform \hfill \small {{-} September, 2021} \\

    % Bullet #1
    \tab $\bullet$ Provided continued support for the customer lifetime value prediction \\
    \tab[1.25cm] process, and helped create internal packages and templates for data scientists \\
    \tab[1.25cm] to use for easier machine learning model deployment in AWS SageMaker. \\
    \vspace*{0.5mm}

    % Bullet #2
    \tab $\bullet$ Worked on developing SageMaker Endpoint APIs and serverless infrastructure \\
    \tab[1.25cm] to transition the scoring of users' telematics scores out of a Ruby on Rails app. \\

    \tab[0.5cm] \textit{Technology Used:} R, SQL, Python, AWS, Docker, git, Tableau \hfill \small{{-} March 2020} \\

    % Bullet #1
    \tab $\bullet$ Set up the initial daily customer lifetime value prediction process \\
    \tab[1.25cm] using AWS SageMaker, Lambda, and an internal data extraction tool. These \\
    \tab[1.25cm] results, while originally for the growth marketing team, became a staple \\
    \tab[1.25cm] in the company's overall decision making process.
    \vspace*{0.5mm}

    % Bullet #2
    \tab $\bullet$ Led the analysis for several meaningful A/B tests in the mobile app \\
    \tab[1.25cm] experience, including: the efficacy of providing easy access to phone support \\
    \tab[1.25cm] during key points in the customer journey, and the improvement to several \\
    \tab[1.25cm] business metrics by allowing customer choice to affect their product experience. \\
    \vspace*{0.5mm}

    % Bullet #3
    \tab $\bullet$ Worked to standardize the analysis of conversion A/B tests by creating \\
    \tab[1.25cm] an R package that provides analysts an abstraction for conducting a Bayesian \\
    \tab[1.25cm] analysis and produces a standardized report of the results. \\

    \textbf{Associate Data Scientist} \tab[.25cm] \textit{American Electric Power} \tab[.15cm] \small{Columbus OH} \hfill {January, 2017} \\
    \tab[0.5cm] \textit{Technology Used:} Python, R, Oracle, Linux, Docker, git \hfill \small{{-} October, 2018} \\

    % Bullet #1
    \tab $\bullet$ Created a daily statistical process for a quality control team that \\
    \tab[1.25cm] automated the prediction and cataloguing of potential errors in transmission data \\
    \tab[1.25cm] for 750 large commercial customers. Additionally, a dashboard created with Oracle \\
    \tab[1.25cm] APEX provided the team with a workflow to view and post notes about the predictions. \\
    \vspace*{0.5mm}

    % Bullet #2
    \tab $\bullet$ Developed a data analysis tool and discrete-event simulation program \\
    \tab[1.25cm] that provided the ability to analyze the expected annualized costs for \\
    \tab[1.25cm] various predictive maintenance inspection regimens of the Amos power plant. \\
    \vspace*{0.5mm}

    % Bullet #3
    \tab $\bullet$ Co-led an internal monthly meet-up around the uses of Python and R for \\
    \tab[1.25cm] analytics, where we typically had between 5 and 10 people each month. \\
