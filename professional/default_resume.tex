    \medskip

    % Bullet #1
    \tab $\bullet$ Provided continued support for the customer lifetime value prediction \\
    \tab[1.25cm] process, and helped create internal packages and templates for data scientists \\
    \tab[1.25cm] to use for easier machine learning model deployment in AWS SageMaker. \\
    \vspace*{0.5mm}

    % Bullet #2
    \tab $\bullet$ Worked on developing SageMaker Endpoint APIs and serverless infrastructure \\
    \tab[1.25cm] to transition the scoring of users' telematics scores out of a Ruby on Rails app. \\

    % Bullet #1
    \tab $\bullet$ Set up the initial daily customer lifetime value prediction process \\
    \tab[1.25cm] using AWS SageMaker, Lambda, and an internal data extraction tool. These \\

    \tab[1.25cm] experience, including: the efficacy of providing easy access to phone support \\
    \tab[1.25cm] during key points in the customer journey, and the improvement to several \\
    \tab[1.25cm] business metrics by allowing customer choice to affect their product experience. \\
    \vspace*{0.5mm}

    % Bullet #3
    \tab $\bullet$ Worked to standardize the analysis of conversion A/B tests by creating \\
    \tab[1.25cm] an R package that provides analysts an abstraction for conducting a Bayesian \\
    \tab[1.25cm] analysis and produces a standardized report of the results. \\

    \tab[1.25cm] automated the prediction and cataloguing of potential errors in transmission data \\
    \tab[1.25cm] for 750 large commercial customers. Additionally, a dashboard created with Oracle \\
    \tab[1.25cm] APEX provided the team with a workflow to view and post notes about the predictions. \\
    \vspace*{0.5mm}

    % Bullet #2
    \tab $\bullet$ Developed a data analysis tool and discrete-event simulation program \\
    \tab[1.25cm] that provided the ability to analyze the expected annualized costs for \\
