# [Seven simple mistakes to avoid by Avinash Kaushik](https://www.kaushik.net/avinash/data-analysis-101-seven-simple-mistakes/)

1. Never compare apples to watermelons: "Are my segments all at the right altitude? Are they individually unpolluted by the other?"
2. Don't alarm HiPPOs and Sr. Leaders unnecessarily
3. Calibrate your time series optimally
    - ≤ 4 weeks of data ➡ use daily values
    - ≤ 3 months of data ➡ use weekly values
    - > 3 months of data ➡ use monthly values
4. Always, always, always make your point clearly! (And color counts too)
5. Statistical significance is your BFF
6. There is such a thing as too little data: Don't waste time trying to come up with conclusions if there just isn't enough data, use your time instead to look for surprises and assure yourself that the data looks as you might expect it would.
7. Pie charts are evil!
