# ["What makes a data analyst excellent" by Cassie Kozyrkov](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-makes-a-data-analyst-excellent-17ee4651c6db)

- Summary of what analytics is not: analytics is not statistics ("Analytics helps you form hypotheses, improving the quality of your questions; statistics helps you test hypotheses, improving the quality of your answers"), analytics is not data journalism/marketing/storytelling, and analytics is not decision-making.
- "Analysts look up facts and produce inspiration for you, while trying to waste as little of their time (and yours!) in the process. To get the best time-to-inspiration payoff, they must master many different forms of speed:
    - Speed of getting data that's promising and relevant (domain knowledge)
    - Speed of getting data ready for manipulation (software skills)
    - Speed of getting data summarized (mathematical skills)
    - Speed of getting data summaries into their own brains (data visualization skills)
    - Speed of getting data summaries into stakeholder's brains (communication skills)
    - Speed of getting the decision-maker inspired (business acumen)
- For the decision-maker: "â€¦ if analyst find nothing valuable in a dataset you asked them to examine for you, don't punish them. Keeping them around is an investment in being able to see in new ways. If you don't like what you're looking at, direct them towards a scene with more potential."
