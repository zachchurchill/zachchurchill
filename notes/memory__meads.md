|Battle Axe|"A sweet cranberry melomel infused with vanilla and juniper berries. Unapologetically tart upfront like cranberries with a smooth finish that is sweet and hints at the vanilla and juniper infusion."|
|Blueberry Yum Yum|Blueberry|
|California Gold|"Dry traditional with Mendocino Forest honey aged on American oak"|
|Honey Oak|"Ohio wildflower honey traditional mead aged on French and American Oak. Pronounced honey nose. Flavors of caramel and woodiness are enhance by the oak."|
|Blackjack|"Crafted from locally sourced raw honey and black currant, Blackjack is a 21 on flavor. Our tart and earthy berry brew has full, smooth body from honey. The finish is slightly sweet. Game on."|
|Passion|"A blend of honey and passion fruit."|
|Julien's Pyment|"A genius is born! Our mead master, Julian, has taken bold first steps into grape fermentation with this tasty riff on the pyment style - honey blended with Concord grapes and blueberries. Enjoy!"|
|Gravenstein|"A dry slightly carbonated and sour cyser from Gravenstein varietal apples from Sonoma and wildflower honey from Mendocino."|
|Wild Ohio|"Wild Ohio is mead in its most traditional form. Just local raw wildflower honey, water and yeast are blended and fermented. Sugar removed during fermentation leaves only flavors of honey wine with a semi-dry finish."|
