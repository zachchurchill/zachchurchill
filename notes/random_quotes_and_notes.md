# Random Quotes and Notes

- "A good statistician needs to know more than formulas and numbers - they need to really understand the environment they are looking to measure." - Eddie Davila, “Explaining unexpected outcomes” - Statistics Foundation 2 in LinkedIn Learning.
- "Business intelligence consists of two diametrically opposed activities: top-down, metrics-driven reporting and dashboarding where you know in advance what things you want to monitor, and bottom-up, ad-hoc analysis to answer unanticipated questions." - [The Starter Guide to Business Intelligence](https://www.klipfolio.com/blog/starter-guide-to-business-intelligence) (Wayne Eckerson is who they are quoting)
- On the language to use when rejecting a null hypothesis: "We can be reasonably sure sure that the outcome exhibited by the treatment population did not occur by chance." - Eddie Davila, Statistics Foundation 3 in LinkedIn Learning
- Note about the use of statistical tests: "Chi-square is more appropriate to use when the data is categorized, while t-tests are used to evaluate a null hypothesis when 2 sets of data are collected but not categorized." - Eddie Davila, Statistics Foundation 3 in LinkedIn Learning
- The Coefficient of Determination (R^2) provides the percent of variation that is explained by the given regressor, whereas the Correlation Coefficient (r) provides a summary of the linear relationship/trend and tightness of fit of the data points to the regression line. - Eddie Davila, Statistics Foundations 3 in LinkedIn Learning
- Use Subject-Matter Experts (SMEs) to widen search in a data mining project, and let the computer/algorithms narrow it. Ask the SME, "Am I leaving anything out?" - SMEs are important for providing context that cannot be gleaned from the data. - Keith McCormick, The Essential Elements of Predictive Analytics and Data Mining, LinkedIn Learning
- Predictable mistakes in data mining, which Keith describes as the process of presenting data that has already been collected through the normal course of doing business to a data mining (iterative) algorithm in such a way that your business question can be asked and answered by the data (i.e. data-driven), are: (Keith McCormick, The Essential Elements of Predictive Analytics and Data Mining, LinkedIn Learning)
    - Worrying about statistical assumptions and rules even when they don't apply
    - Using hypothesis testing on ideas generated while exploring the data on the same, non-experimental data – we're not doing the scientific method in data mining because we're not starting with an a priori hypothesis nor generating experimental data on ideas gleaned from data exploration.
    - Limiting the solution search based on a priori knowledge – in data mining we carefully define the problem, craft the data set to help us solve it, but then do a wide open search of all the possible solutions. These allows us to be surprised by results and provide previously unknown insights.
