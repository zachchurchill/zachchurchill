# ["What Great Data Analysts Do…" by Cassie Kozyrkov](https://hbr.org/2018/12/what-great-data-analysts-do-and-why-every-organization-needs-them)

The following roles are narrow-and-deep experts:
- "Statisticians are specialists in coming to conclusions beyond your data safely - they are your best protection against fooling yourself in an uncertain world … they use data to minimize the chance that you'll come to an unwise conclusion."
- "…an applied ML/AI engineer (has) … the coding chops to build both prototypes and production systems that work … engineering excellence is a must."

On analysts:
- "The analysts are lightning-fast coders who can surf vast datasets quickly, encountering and surfacing potential insights faster than those other specialists can say 'whiteboard' … the result is that the business gets a finger on its pulse and eyes on previously-unknown unknowns. This generates the inspiration that helps decision-makers select valuable quests to send statisticians and ML engineers on, saving them from mathematically-impressive excavations of useless rabbit holes."
- "Good analysts have unwavering respect for the one golden rule of their profession: do not come to conclusions beyond the data (and prevent your audience from doing it, too)."
- "As long as analysts stick to the facts - only saying 'this is what is here' - and don't take themselves too seriously, the worst crime they could commit is wasting someone's time when they run it by them."
- "…the best analysts are serious about familiarizing themselves with the domain. Failure to do so is a red flag."
- "An excellent analyst is not a shoddy version of the ML engineer; their coding style is optimized for speed - on purpose. Nor are they a bad statistician, since they don't deal at all with uncertainty, they deal with facts. The primary job of the analyst is to say: 'Here's what's in our data. It's not my job to talk about what it means, but perhaps it will inspire the decision-maker to pursue the question with a statistician."
