|El Chavo|"This sweet heated blend melds Blake’s homegrown habanero peppers with juicy mango and our famous Blake’s apples. He’s sweet with a little heat, feel the burn with El Chavo."|
|Triple Jam|"Inspired by the juicy berries we grow on our farm each summer, Triple Jam is the perfect balance of ripe sweetness with bold fruit aromatics. Bursting with strawberries, blackberries, and raspberries, this semi-sweet captivates the nuance of our farm, in each and every taste."|
