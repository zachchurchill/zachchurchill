# [Actively Avoid Insights: 4 Useful KPI Measurement Techniques by Avinash Kaushik](https://www.kaushik.net/avinash/insights-web-analytics-kpi-measurement-techniques/)

He defines a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) as "**Measures** that help you understand how you are doing against your **objectives**." If your KPI doesn't meet both measures and objectives, it's not a KPI.

## Averages
- "No one is 'average' and no user experience is 'average'."
- "Averages have an astonishing capacity to give your "average" data, they have a great capacity to lie, and they hinder decision making."

### What can we do to improve?

1. Segment the data – providing the averages for these most important/interesting segments against an overall average will help prod questions and provide some insight behind the numbers.
2. Distributions – providing the numbers that create the average can provide insights into how the population actually looks, e.g. using an equal-binning technique on the x-axis of a histogram can provide a great look into how the data is distributed from the 1st to 99th percentiles.

## Percentages

"Some percentages are ok, but very very rarely are they good at answering the 'so what' or the 'now what' questions."

### What can we do to improve?

1. Segment the data – do it.
2. Always show raw numbers – percentages by themselves are often misleading.
3. Don't use % delta! Use statistical significance or statistical control limits instead.

## Ratios

"The first challenge is to be careful of is that the two underlying numbers could shift dramatically without any impact on your ratio. The second challenge occurs when you compare two campaigns or sources or people or other such uniquely valuable things as it invites gaming the numerator/denominator to achieve the 'desired' ratio."

### What can we do to improve?

1. Resist just showing the ratio: "Throw in a raw number, throw in some other type of context and you are on your way to sowing something that will highlight an important facet and prod good questions."
2. Resist the temptation to set "golden" rules of thumb, e.g. although we target a loss ratio number, we usually emphasize increasing earned premium by setting rates commensurate with the risk of loss (the denominator) rather than trying to get out of paying losses (numerator).

## Compound Metrics

"A compound metric is a metric whose sub-components are other metrics", e.g. a combined ratio is a combination of loss ratio and expense ratio. Although Avinash seems to be focused more on non-standardized compound metrics that may be created for a specific web analytics A/B test.

### What can we do to improve?

1. Take them with a grain of salt.
2. Degrade to key "critical few" components.
3. Revisit and revalidate.

## Wrap-up

Above all else, approach KPIs with an "Analysis Ninja" mental model – "…your entire existence is geared towards driving action. So think, stress test, be smart about the math you do. Computers and calculators are cheap but it does not excuse doing the things outlined above."
